Moringa School is a friendly community where you learn to code and develop professionally.

**We help our campers build job-worthy portfolios of real apps used by real people, while growing.**

You start by working through our self-paced, browser-based Moringa Prep Course.

### By working through our curriculum, you can earn four certifications:
##### 1. Front End Certification
The first section will teach you the basics of how webpages work and also introduce you to JavaScript programming.

Skills you'll practice include `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript`, `jQuery`, `AngularJS`, `EmberJS` and `Bootstrap`.

To earn this certification, you'll build **10 front-end projects** and implement many **JavaScript algorithms**.

##### 2. Back End Certification
The third section introduces you to back end development using `Ruby`, `Rails,` and `MongoDB`. It also teaches you about the important concept of source control using `Git`.

To earn this certification, you'll build **5 APIs** and **5 full stack apps**.

We will accept solutions implemented in the taught programming languages, as long as both a live demo and the source code are publicly accessible.

##### 3. Full Stack Certification
The fourth section is where you'll get **real-world experience** by working on **group projects**.
We'll pair you with another camper and a facilitator. Together, you'll plan, build and maintain software projects to help you learn more effectively.

For this certification, you'll work on **two projects from scratch** and then **maintain/upgrade two existing projects**.
